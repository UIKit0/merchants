CAVIRTEX Shopping Cart Plugins
==============================

Shopping cart plugins using the cavirtex merchant API.

VirtEx is seeking Developers to submit plug-ins to integrate the VirtEx merchant api with mainstream shopping carts. We are issuing a $500 reward per plug-in via a bounty system which will function as follows:  If 5 developers submit a wordpress plug-in, our development team will review the submissions and appoint a winner and then award 1 winner $500 CAD to their VirtEx account.  The winner can then withdraw the CAD or convert to BTC and withdraw.  The plug-ins we require integration for are listed on our Github page at www.github.com/cavirtex.  To participate follow these steps:
 
1) Create a VirtEx account and email reed@cavirtex.com with a request to make your account a merchant account for the purpose of development. Note that you must have a merchant account with VirtEx for the merchant API to work.  If you require CAD or BTC for testing purposes, simply deposit small amounts of BTC to your VirtEx account either directly or through the merchant API and convert to CAD as necessary, you can then simply withdraw the BTC when complete. We do not provide any test BTC or CAD, this is your responsibility.
 
2) Create your own github page, fork our repository (https://github.com/cavirtex/merchants), add or merge your plugin codebase into a subfolder and create a pull request when you are finished. Be sure to include full documentation on how to install the plug-in. Reference available here: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
 
3) Once development is complete and you are ready to make a submission for the bounty please email virtexgithub@gmail.com with your github page and the shopping cart you have implemented and wait for a response.
 
4) Our github page contains the merchant API documentation as well as an up to date list of approved plug-ins, do NOT do development work on Approved plug-ins.  $500 Bounty rewards are only available for the Plugins Awaiting Submission list. If you want to develop for a shopping cart that is not on this list and for general inquiries please e-mail reed@cavirtex.com.
